Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What are the names of the members of your team?
Ben Wakefield


2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw06.wenbakefield.com


3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I had a lot of trouble with the game logic in this assignment, and
heavily relied upon external code that I modified with attribution.
I think that it would've been much more beneficial to me to have
worked in a team rather than by myself, as I found the workload
too much. I have certainly learned my lesson and in the future
I will not have to resort to this strategy.


4. What part of your application state is on the server?
All state and game logic is handled on the server.


5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?
The state of the game is recieved from the server in the browser.
Additionally, each player's name is stored individually in the
browser.
